# Module 9: SQL

# Breakdown
For this module, I uploaded two SQL files to the repo: one for creating the tables and another for the actual queries. I added a PNG file of the Entity Relationship Diagram via <www.quickdatabasediagrams.com> into the repo titled "FINAL ENTITY".

All the code was handwritten by myself and I had my tutor double-check the syntax. I've commented out the question number for each part of the code that references it. For question #8 of the challenge, I consulted ChatGPT for parts of the code and had help from my tutor to refine the syntax.
